# BikeShare Des Moines

## Overview
This project is an analysis of data from a New York City bike sharing program to determine  trends that could be used to recommend starting a similar program in Des Moines. Given the large dataset with varied types of data for each trip, data visualization is the clearest way to describe the results.

The first step in determining if bike sharing is a good fit for Des Moines is to look at the rider demographics and ride characteristics to determine who rides the most and when they are using the bikes.<br/>The two most important rider demographics are member type and gender.

</p>
-The majority of users are subscribers, which suggests they are both local and frequent users. <br/>
-Most of the users are men. This may be because men are more comfortable riding in the city, but could also be an opportunity to create an outreach program to get more women riding.
<p/>Ride times and ride duration are important factors because they not only tell how much utilization can be expected throughout the day, but they can also offer insight into how the bikes are being used.

- Trips throughout the week are fairly consisitent. Customers are slightly more active on the weekends. Subscribers are most active during the week, although there is a dip in activity in the middle of the week.
-Start times on the weekend are distributed between about 8 AM and 8 PM, with rides increasing between 8 AM and noon, peaking between noon and 5 PM, and tapering down bewtween 5 PM and 8 PM.
-Start times during the week are clustered around the morning and evening commutes. There is some activity in the middle of the day, but it looks as though the majority of weekday rides are used to get to and from work.<br/>

-When start time per day is broken out by gender, it shows that the mid day trends both during the week and on the weekends are similar, but that men ride more late at night.

</p>
-The vast majority of rides are under half an hour, with the largest number being 5-6 minutes. This suggests that people primarily use the bikes for quick, short-distance trips, but may choose another transportation option for longer distances. This trend is true across genders, although there is less of a dramatic spike for the riders that did not identify. The daily trips by gender, separated by user type showed that the users who did not indicate gender were mostly customers, not subscribers. And a person trying the service out, or using it once for a weekend tourist trip is less likely to completely fill out profile information, and more likely to spend a little more time checking things out.

After using the above information to convince investors that bike sharing is a viable business for Des Moines, you would then need to assure them that you have a handle on how to keep the business running smoothly.

-You can keep track of the most popular locations to make sure that the bikes are deployed in the right areas.<br/>
-You can keep track of how much use each bike gets, so you can properly schedule maintenance. <p/>

## Results
Overall, the data gathered provides a good argument for starting a similar program in Des Moines. The majority of rides appear to be taken by locals as an alternative to other transportation, and while the majority of users are men, women make up a healthy quarter. Prior to comitting to the program, I would want to look at information. Specifically, I'd want to look at data for other times of the year. August is a good indicator for the summer months, but is ridership different in the spring, fall and winter? I'd also want to look at the age breakdown of users and compare that to the demographics of Des Moines.
